# Angular

Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications using TypeScript/JavaScript and other languages.

## Quickstart

# Set up your environment
Go to https://angular.io/guide/setup-local

To create a new workspace and an initial app project:
-----------
* Ensure that you are not already in an Angular workspace folder. For example, if you have previously created the Getting Started workspace, change to the parent of that folder.

* Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name angular-tour-of-heroes, as shown here:

        ng new angular-tour-of-heroes
        
* ng newThe command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial app project. Accept the defaults by pressing the Enter or Return key.

# The initial app project contains a simple Welcome app, ready to run.

Serve the application
-----------
* Go to the workspace directory and launch the application.

      cd angular-tour-of-heroes
      ng serve --open
        
> ng serveThe command builds the app, starts the development server, watches the source files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.
> --openThe flag opens a browser to http://localhost:4200/.

You should see the app running in your browser.
