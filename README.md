# Angular

Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications using TypeScript/JavaScript and other languages.

## Quickstart

# Set up your environment
Go to https://angular.io/guide/setup-local

Ensure that you are not already in an Angular workspace folder. For example, if you have previously created the Getting Started workspace, change to the parent of that folder.

Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name angular-tour-of-heroes, as shown here:

ng new angular-tour-of-heroes
